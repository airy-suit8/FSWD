Develop a user authentication portal for an organization using the MongoDB,
Express.js, React, and Node.js (MERN) stack. The web application should include
the following features:
1. A registration module where new users can sign up, and their details are
stored in MongoDB.
2. A login module that validates user credentials through the backend built
with Node.js.
3. An interactive frontend interface designed using React.js for seamless
navigation.
4. Secure handling of user information with proper encryption techniques.
Finally, maintain and share the complete project through a GitHub Repository to
support version control and collaborative development.
